The challenges is to recreate a mockup website using HTML and CSS. 

There are two versions of the mock webpage included: a desktop and a mobile version. 

The key features of this layout that must be replicated are the navbar, header, and two-column section at the bottom of the page.
As the page size grows and shrinks, the navbar, header, and two-column sections should grow and shrink with it (take up all horizonatally avaliable space).
Render has one narrow column and one wide column using Flexbox. 
There should be no floats.

For this website I decided to make both a website and mobile version for a science/space website.
